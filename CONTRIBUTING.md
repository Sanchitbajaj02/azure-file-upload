# Contribution Guidelines

## 👋 Welcome Contributer!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to my project. It's people like you that make a project such a great tool.

## 🤔 Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one!](https://github.com/Sanchitbajaj02/azure-file-upload/issues/new). It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question about **azure-file-upload**, you can also make an issue about it.

## 🍴 Fork & create a branch

If it is something you think you can fix, then fork **azure-file-upload** and create a branch with a descriptive name.

```sh
git checkout -b branch-name-here
```

## ⚔️ Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first 😸

## 🔃 Create a pull request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with **azure-file-upload**'s master branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Sanchitbajaj02/azure-file-upload.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then switch back to your feature branch and [merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) it on top of master:

```sh
git checkout branch-name-here
git merge master
```

Finally, push it to your fork and submit a pull request
